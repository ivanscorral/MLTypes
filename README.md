# MLTypes

## Overview

`MLTypes` is a Swift package offering advanced types and extensions for machine learning applications. Focused on providing robust, Swift-native implementations for vectors and matrices, it includes extensions for standard types, enhancing their functionality in ML scenarios.

## Features

- `MLVector`: Generic vector implementation with customizable element types. Supports initialization, element manipulation, and ML-specific operations.
- `MLMatrix`: Generic matrix structure to represent and manipulate 2D data arrays in ML models.
- `Randomizable` Protocol: Allows for the random initialization of numeric types, vital for stochastic aspects of ML algorithms.
- `IntegerExtensions` & `FloatingPointExtensions`: Extend native Swift types to fit into ML contexts seamlessly.

## Roadmap

- **Performance Optimization**: Refine current implementations for better performance, especially for large-scale data.
- **Advanced Operations**: Introduce more complex vector and matrix operations, like dot product, cross product, matrix inversion, etc.
- **ML Algorithms Integration**: Facilitate integration with common ML algorithms, possibly collaborating with other ML frameworks.
- **Documentation & Examples**: Expand documentation with more examples and use cases.
- **Testing & Validation**: Develop a comprehensive test suite to ensure reliability and accuracy.
